# üéÆ GamePlayers ‚Äì Figma to Web (CMS Powered)

This project is a **pixel-perfect translation** of a free Figma design into a responsive website, with an added **JSON-powered CMS layer** for easy customization of navigation links, CTAs, and hero section content.  

The goal was to practice **front-end development, responsiveness, accessibility, and dynamic content loading**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the CMS Works
- A `cms.json` file holds customizable values (logo, nav links, CTAs, social links, etc.)  
- On page load, `main.js` fetches `cms.json` and updates the DOM dynamically  
- Example (cms.json):
```json
{
  "logoImage": "./assets/icons/logo.svg",
  "companyName": { "firstHalf": "GAME", "secondHalf": "PLAYERS" },
  "navItems": {
    "navLinks": [
      { "label": "Home", "url": "#" },
      { "label": "About", "url": "#about" },
      { "label": "Subscription", "url": "#subscription" }
    ],
    "navButtons": [
      { "label": "Dashboard", "url": "/dashboard" },
      { "label": "Download", "url": "#" }
    ]
  },
  "hero": {
    "title": { "firstHalf": "GAME", "secondHalf": "PLAYERS" },
    "description": "Are you tired of toxic players and trolls?...",
    "groupCTA": [
      { "label": "Download now", "url": "#" },
      { "label": "Or go to Dashboard", "url": "#" }
    ],
    "socialLinks": [
      { "platform": "discord", "url": "http://" },
      { "platform": "instagram", "url": "http://" },
      { "platform": "twitter", "url": "http://" },
      { "platform": "facebook", "url": "http://" }
    ]
  }
